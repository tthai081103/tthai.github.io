               Who am I:  My name is Toan Bach Thai (Thái Bách Toàn). I am an international student from Vietnam. I studied high school in America for 2 years in St. Bernard, Eureka. I have been to UC Davis, UCLA Extension and currently studying at University of San Diego. I am currently living in City Height, San Diego.

                Professional info: I am currently majoring in Computer Science, Cyber Security. I am currently a sophomore and will be a junior in 2025. Aside from focusing on cyber security, I am interested in making games but more specifically, games that are not extravagant in visual and audio but rather fun mechanics and fun to retry. In addition, I would like to add some stories, lore to my game given the chance because I love telling stories through games. 

               </p>
               <p>
                Hobbies: I enjoy playing video games in my free time, pc, console and mobile but more often mobile since it’s easy to carry around and the age of mobile video game being the worst had ended long ago and newer great games are coming. Aside from that I also enjoy collecting anime related cards. As stated before I love telling stories through video games because many of the stories I experienced are from them. Video games are fun to play but I want to use the players skill in game to not only get satisfaction from achieving wins but to also get themself an emotional, thought-provoking, romantic, every possible story genre adjective as an extra reward.

              <h3>”The Snake Game, but it get worse”</h3>
              <p>
               Motivation of the project:  Initially, I just wanted to make the Snake Game but I know it’s too boring and wanted to add a twist in. Firstly, I want as the players play, the gaming experience will get worse for them and more frustrating so that they can gain a better and satisfying win at the end than just normally get as much score as possible. I make it worse by adding random obstacles every 5 apples eaten. Secondly, I want the player to uncover an intriguing and inspirational story as they get higher points into the game. I believe one of the best ways to tell a story is to tell it through video games.

              </p>
              <p>
              Functional requirements/what the project does: The game I made is similar to how the normal Snake Game play: you will control the snake by arrow keys on the keyboard and your objective is to try to eat apples that are spawn randomly on the game stage to get points and longer. The things I added in for the game to be more interesting are random generated obstacles:  random spawn obstacles that appear and stay at that position permanently, random moving obstacles coming from the top and left, diagonally moving lightning obstacles, countdown timer and finally portals. Additional information: every 10 normal apples will spawn a golden apple that gets you 50 points and increases game speed and finally, there will be a boss that spawn in the middle of the game stage with a health point of 10/10 and to reduce the boss HP, you have to eat golden apples. The true goal of this game is not to get as many points as possible but to uncover a story behind this game. As you play, messages will appear on the screen to form a story and at the end, when Boss HP is at 0/10, you would have collected all the messages to form a complete story.

              </p>
              <p>
              Project design:  I make this game in Java. To make this game in java, I used JFrame (Swing) to draw the 2D objects on the screen and AWT for user input. My original plan is to add different obstacles as I develop the game so I want the code to be extensionable as possible so ultimately, the game has 2 parts: the Entities (design what snake, apples, obstacles looks like) and Panels (GamePanel and InfoPanel with GamePanel being the main brain of the game, deciding how entities work and InfoPanel for status of the game). By using the abstract GameEntity class, I was able to add in as many obstacles I want in the future without too much refactoring code. 

              </p>
              <p>
              Implementation:  With this being a one person project, I am unfortunately responsible for all the work. In order for this game to fully work as I intended, I had to not only write tests for it, i had to replay the game constantly to make sure the players had a chance to get to the final message to get the story fully and I had to retry the game a large amount of time just to make sure.
